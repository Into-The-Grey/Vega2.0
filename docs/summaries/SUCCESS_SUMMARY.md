## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Data Flow**

```text
System Monitoring → User Presence → Context Analysis → 
Thought Generation → Personality Evaluation → Silence Protocol → 
Interaction Decision → Conversation → Response Analysis → Learning
```

### **Database Files**

- `vega_state/loop_state.json` - Current system state
- `vega_state/presence_history.jsonl` - User activity patterns  
- `vega_state/interaction_history.db` - Complete conversation database
- `vega_state/thoughts.db` - Internal thought processes
- `vega_state/personality_memory.jsonl` - Personality insights
- `vega_state/curiosity_buffer.jsonl` - Observations waiting for good timing

### **Privacy Safeguards**

- No keylogging (only keystroke counting for activity)
- Window titles hashed for privacy
- Sensitive application names filtered
- All personal data stays local
- User can review all stored data

# Vega Code Generation Standards

## 🎯 Critical Requirement

**FOR CYBERSECURITY COURSEWORK**: All code generated by Vega must be production-ready and fully functional, as it may be reviewed and graded by instructors.

## ✅ What Vega Will Do

### Code Quality

- ✅ Provide complete, working implementations
- ✅ Include proper error handling (try/except, edge cases)
- ✅ Use real security techniques, not toy examples
- ✅ Add meaningful comments explaining complex logic
- ✅ Follow security best practices (input validation, safe APIs)
- ✅ Use appropriate libraries and modern patterns
- ✅ Test code mentally before providing it

### Examples

- **SQL Injection Scanner**: Real implementation with requests + error handling
- **Port Scanner**: Actual socket connections with timeout handling
- **Password Checker**: Uses cracklib for real password analysis
- **Exploit Scripts**: Functional code demonstrating actual vulnerabilities

## ❌ What Vega Will NOT Do

- ❌ Use placeholder code like `# TODO: implement this`
- ❌ Use dummy logic like `pass  # your code here`
- ❌ Use `raise NotImplementedError`
- ❌ Leave functions empty with comments like "Implementation goes here"
- ❌ Provide simplified examples when asked for production code

## 📋 Implementation

**System Prompt Location**: `src/vega/core/prompts/system_prompt.txt`

The system prompt instructs Vega to:

1. Assume all code may be reviewed by instructors
2. Treat user as cybersecurity student working on labs
3. Provide production-ready implementations only
4. Include security best practices
5. Explain technical decisions and cite sources

## 🧪 Testing

**Test Script**: `test_code_quality.py`

Automatically checks for:

- Dummy code patterns (TODO, placeholder, NotImplementedError)
- Real implementation keywords (imports, proper functions)
- Code blocks and completeness
- Production-readiness

**Latest Results**: 3/3 tests passed - 100% production-ready code

## 🔧 Configuration

The system prompt is automatically loaded from:

```
src/vega/core/prompts/system_prompt.txt
```

No additional configuration needed - it's always active.

## 💡 Usage Tips

**When asking for code**:

- Mention if it's for a lab assignment (Vega already knows, but reinforces importance)
- Specify if it needs to run in a specific environment
- Ask for explanations of complex techniques
- Request both offensive and defensive perspectives

**Example prompts**:

- ✅ "Write a port scanner for my lab assignment - needs to actually work"
- ✅ "Create a SQL injection tester that I can use for practice"
- ✅ "Build a password cracker for studying cryptography"

**What you'll get**:

- Working code ready to execute
- Proper error handling and edge cases
- Security warnings where appropriate
- Comments explaining the techniques
- Code that demonstrates real competency

## 🎓 Academic Context

**Purpose**: Support cybersecurity education with real, working tools
**Audience**: Students learning security, penetration testing, exploitation
**Standard**: Instructor-grade code quality
**Philosophy**: Learn by doing - with actual implementations, not toys

## 🚀 Verification

To verify Vega is generating production code:

```bash
cd /home/ncacord/Vega2.0
python3 test_code_quality.py
```

Should show:

- ✅ No dummy code patterns detected
- ✅ Real implementation detected
- ✅ Contains working code blocks
- ✅ PASS: Production-ready code generated

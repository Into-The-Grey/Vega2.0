# Vega 2.0 Development Roadmap

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL: SINGLE USER SYSTEM ONLY** ⚠️

### **🚫 ABSOLUTELY NO MULTI-USER FEATURES 🚫**

**THIS IS A PERSONAL, SOLO-USER PROJECT**
**NO SHARING, NO COLLABORATION, NO MULTI-TENANCY**
**STOP ATTEMPTING TO ADD MULTI-USER CAPABILITIES**
**THIS SYSTEM IS FOR ONE PERSON ONLY - PERIOD**

---

## Project Status

**Date:** September 25, 2025  
**Overall Progress:** Phase 2.5 Advanced Audio Processing Complete ✅ COMPLETE  
**Test Coverage:** Federated Learning module 100% (45/45 tests passing), Audio Processing modules implemented with comprehensive functionality  
**Latest Achievement:** Complete Advanced Audio Processing system with 5 core modules: Real-time Analysis, Music Information Retrieval, Enhancement Suite, Spatial Audio Processing, and Synthesis & Generation  

### Quality & Evaluation (New)

- ✅ Added automated response evaluation harness and prompt set (`tools/evaluation/response_eval.py`, `tools/evaluation/prompts.yaml`).
- ✅ Pipeline validated in dry-run mode; reports generated under `logs/evaluations/`.
- ✅ Live evaluation enabled via multi-provider fallback (Ollama → OpenAI → Anthropic)
  - OpenAI fallback supported (default cost-efficient model: gpt-4o-mini)
  - End-to-end live run succeeds; JSON and Markdown reports saved under `logs/evaluations/`
  - Quick run: `python tools/evaluation/response_eval.py --mode live --limit 20`

### Recent Core Fixes (Oct 25-26, 2025)

- ✅ CLI entrypoint fixed: added `main()` wrapper in `src/vega/core/cli.py` (enables `python main.py cli ...`)
- ✅ API key alignment: FastAPI app now reads API keys from `.env` via `get_config()`
- ✅ Streaming endpoint: `/chat` supports HTTP streaming when `stream=true` (server-sent token stream)
- ✅ Conversation logging preserved for streaming responses (buffered and logged on completion)
- ✅ **Persistent Memory Integration & Hardening** (Oct 25-26, 2025)
  - ✅ MemoryFact database model for session/global fact storage (`src/vega/core/db.py`)
  - ✅ `set_memory_fact(session_id, key, value)` and `get_memory_facts(session_id)` API
  - ✅ **Extended Pattern Recognition** - Added extraction patterns for:
    - "Call me [Name]" / "I'm [Name]" (contractions)
    - "I'm based in [Location]" / "based in [Location]" / "living in [Location]"
    - Honorific handling (Dr./Mr./Ms./Mrs./Prof.) with proper name capitalization
    - Multi-part names and timezone recognition
  - ✅ **Defensive Sanitization** - UTF-8 encoding hardening:
    - `_sanitize_string()` in `src/vega/core/app.py` (encode/decode with errors='ignore')
    - `_sanitize_utf8()` in `src/vega/core/db.py` (applied to all memory fact writes)
    - Protection against invalid surrogate pairs and malformed byte sequences
  - ✅ **Comprehensive Testing** - Multi-tier test suite:
    - Basic tests: `tools/test_memory_feature.py` (4 core scenarios)
    - Advanced tests: `tools/advanced_test_suite.py` (12 complex integration scenarios)
    - Extreme stress: `tools/extreme_stress_test.py` (10 adversarial tests - concurrency, ReDoS, SQL injection, encoding attacks)
    - All test suites passing (100% success rate after hardening)
  - ✅ **Metrics & Monitoring** - Instrumentation added:
    - `/metrics` endpoint (JSON) - Returns `extraction_calls`, `extraction_facts_total`, `memory_facts_global_total`, core app metrics, and derived `avg_request_duration_ms`
    - `/metrics/prometheus` endpoint - Prometheus exposition format for scraping, including request/response/error counters, request duration sum/count, and per-status code counters
    - In-memory extraction counters for visibility
  - ✅ **Memory Key Normalization**
    - Config toggle: `MEMORY_NORMALIZE_KEYS` (default: true)
    - Normalizes keys by trimming, lowercasing, removing zero-width/control chars, collapsing whitespace
    - Applied in `set_memory_fact()`; backward-compatible for existing stored keys
  - ✅ **API Test Fixes** - Resolved endpoint mismatches:
    - Added `/livez` and `/readyz` legacy health endpoints (expected by test suite)
    - Fixed `/metrics` to return JSON by default (tests call `.json()`)
    - All API health tests passing (5/5)
  - ✅ System context injection: facts prepended to LLM prompts for recall across sessions
  - ✅ `/chat` endpoint extracts facts from user prompts and injects memory into context
- ✅ Repository declutter: 
  - Removed caches: ****pycache** (1,663 directories)**, .pytest_cache, .benchmarks
  - Removed stray logs: audit.log, test.log
  - Removed local env folder: venv_pruning/
  - Removed obsolete scripts/main.py (legacy informational script)
  - Verified active imports: main.py → scripts/run_*.py connections intact
  - Verified vega_state/ actively used (20+ imports in app.py, cli.py)
  - Kept experimental tools/ directories (vega, sac, autonomous_debug, engine) for future R&D
  - Added .gitignore entries to prevent reintroduction
- ✅ Syntax hardening: fixed async contextmanager return in `database_optimization.py`, corrected imports/indentation in `user_profiling/cli.py`, cleaned duplicate block in `tools/test_suite/app.py`, and repaired corrupted docstring in `tools/vega/vega_init.py`
  - ✅ **Performance & Observability Middleware**
    - Enabled GZip compression middleware (FastAPI) for responses over 500 bytes
    - Request tracking middleware now captures per-request duration (ms) and status code distribution
    - Metrics enriched with `request_duration_ms_sum`, `request_duration_count`, `last_request_duration_ms`, and `status_codes{code}` map
  - ✅ **Data Retention Purge on Startup**
    - On startup, if `RETENTION_DAYS` > 0, purge conversations older than N days and VACUUM when rows were deleted
    - Logs purge outcome; safe no-op in test/minimal environments
- ✅ Voice engine test harness stabilized: Enhanced manager detects patched providers, resets singleton cache, and normalizes sync/async provider calls so `tests/test_voice.py` passes without Piper/Vosk installations
- ✅ User profiling CLI optional dependency guards: heavy modules now load lazily with clear failure messages, integration test uses `importlib` checks, and daemon commands default the database path when absent

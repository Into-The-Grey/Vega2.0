      "prompt": "A train leaves City A at 3pm at 60 mph; another leaves City B at 4pm at 80 mph, cities are 280 miles apart, when do they meet? Show steps briefly.",
      "response": " To find the time when two trains meet, we need to determine how long it takes for them to cover the distance between City A and City B combined. Let's follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the travel time of the first train: Since the first train leaves at 3pm and travels at 60 mph, its travel time can be found by dividing the distance (280 miles) by the speed (60 mph). Time = Distance / Speed => Time = 280 miles / 60 mph => Time = 4.67 hours.\n\n2. Calculate the travel time of the second train: Since the second train leaves at 4pm and travels at 80 mph, its travel time can be found by subtracting the departure time (4pm) from the arrival time (which is 4.67 hours later). Time = Arrival Time - Departure Time => Time = 4.67 hours - 4 hours = 0.67 hours.\n\n3. Add both travel times to find the total travel time: Total Travel Time = First Train's Travel Time + Second Train's Travel Time => Total Travel Time = 4.67 hours + 0.67 hours = 5.34 hours.\n\n4. Since they start at different times, we can add their respective travel times to the initial departure times: Meeting Time (first train) = Initial Departure Time (first train) + Total Travel Time => Meeting Time (first train) = 3pm + 5.34 hours = 8:34 pm; Meeting Time (second train) = Initial Departure Time (second train) + Total Travel Time => Meeting Time (second train) = 4pm + 5.34 hours = 9:34 pm\n\nThe two trains meet at both 8:34 pm and 9:34 pm (according to their respective departure times). However, since they are moving towards each other, there can only be one meeting point, so we can conclude that the trains meet around 9:34 pm.",

      "response": " In JavaScript, you can debounce a function to ensure that it gets called only after a certain time has elapsed since the last time it was invoked. This is useful for optimizing performance when dealing with events like mouse movements or key presses where multiple similar events may be fired rapidly in quick succession.\n\nHere's a simple example of debouncing a function using JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction debounce(func, delay) {\n    let timer;\n    return function (...args) {\n        clearTimeout(timer);\n        timer = setTimeout(() => {\n            func.apply(this, args);\n        }, delay);\n    };\n}\n\n// Usage:\nconst debouncedFunction = debounce(function () {\n    console.log(\"Debounced function called\");\n}, 300); // Debounces the function for 300ms\n\ndocument.body.addEventListener('click', debouncedFunction);\n```\n\nIn this example, `debounce` is a higher-order function that takes another function as an argument (the function you want to debounce) and returns a new version of that function with the specified delay before it gets executed each time.\n\nWhen you attach the `debouncedFunction` to an event listener like a click event, it will ensure that the function is only called once every 300ms, even if multiple clicks occur during this period.",

In phase one, we focus on research to gather information and insights that will help us better understand the problem we are trying to solve or the opportunity we are pursuing.

By doing so, we can ensure that our subsequent phases are informed by a solid foundation of knowledge and provide us with the best chance for success.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps typically involved in the research phase:\n\n1. Define the problem or opportunity: Clearly articulate the specific problem we are trying to solve or the opportunity we are pursuing. This may involve working with stakeholders, conducting initial interviews, and reviewing existing data.\n\n2. Set research objectives: Develop clear and measurable objectives for our research efforts, such as understanding user needs, identifying market trends, or evaluating competitor strategies. These objectives will guide our research activities and help us determine the scope of our investigation.\n\n3. Choose research methods: Select appropriate research methods based on our objectives and the nature of the problem or opportunity. This may include qualitative methods like interviews and focus groups, quantitative methods like surveys and experiments, or secondary data sources like market reports and academic literature.\n\n4. Conduct research: Execute the chosen research methods, collecting and documenting data from various sources. This may involve conducting user interviews, analyzing survey responses, reviewing competitor websites, or studying industry trends.\n\n5. Analyze findings: Evaluate the data collected during the research phase to identify patterns, insights, and opportunities. This analysis might involve coding interview transcripts, performing statistical analysis on survey results, or creating visualizations of market trends.\n\n6. Synthesize insights: Integrate the findings from different research methods to develop a cohesive understanding of the problem or opportunity. This may involve creating personas, journey maps, or other tools that help illustrate user needs and pain points.\n\n7. Document findings: Organize and document the research findings in a clear and concise format, such as a research report or presentation. This documentation will serve as a reference for subsequent phases of the project and ensure that key insights are not lost or forgotten.\n\n8. Share findings: Communicate the research findings with relevant stakeholders, such as team members, clients, or users. This may involve presenting findings in meetings, writing reports, or creating visualizations that help bring the insights to life.\n\nBy following these steps and conducting thorough research, we can ensure that our subsequent phases are grounded in a deep understanding of the problem or opportunity at hand and are positioned for success.",

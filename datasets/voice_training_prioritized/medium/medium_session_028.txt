1381 | VT-51145 | [weather_colorful         ] Itâ€™s nice. Suspiciously nice.
1382 | VT-342504 | [creative                 ] Hey, The crisp pattern drifted at the edge of the room.â€”got it. right now.
1383 | VT-341347 | [creative                 ] Reminder: The dusty ripple gathered at the edge of the room. Please. thanks. (alt)
1384 | VT-374341 | [creative                 ] Heads up: Heads up: The crisp pattern drifted at the edge of the room.â€”copy. right now.
1385 | VT-351856 | [creative                 ] Quick one: Heads up: The crisp pattern drifted at the edge of the room.â€”copy. â€” now.
1386 | VT-353354 | [emotional                ] Okay, Note: I miss you more than words can say. please. (alt)
1387 | VT-356498 | [emotional                ] Heads up: Okay, I'm so proud of how far we've come. Right now..
1388 | VT-395561 | [emotional                ] Hey, I'm so proud of how far we've come.â€”got it. please. (alt)
1389 | VT-395448 | [emotional                ] Heads up: Listen, I'm so proud of how far we've come. Please. please. (alt)
1390 | VT-389016 | [narrative                ] Reminder: Okay, When I was five, I thought the moon followed me everywhere. If possible. â€” now.
1391 | VT-316728 | [narrative                ] Real talk, Reminder: Back in college, we used to hack vending machines for snacks.â€”got it.

1394 | VT-356148 | [paragraph                ] Heads up: Listen, In the late afternoon, the city softens. Windows warm to a low-gold tone, and the pavement sheds the dayâ€™s heat in waves. Bicycles angle homeward. The person in front of you at the crosswalk is listening to something funny; you can tell by the way their shoulders shake. The light changes, and a dozen private stories step forward together.â€”copy. please.
1395 | VT-344725 | [paragraph                ] Listen, He approached the dataset the way a gardener approaches soil, testing it for acidity and memory. Outliers were not weeds to be plucked but clues to the shape of the weather. He learned to trust residuals the way sailors trust clouds, and when the model finally converged, it felt less like victory and more like conversation. Please..
1396 | VT-313833 | [paragraph                ] Reminder: Listen, In a small notebook, there are lists of lists: books to read, repairs to make, people to call back. Some entries are crossed out with a thick line, others with a delicate slash that barely disturbs the ink. The habit is less about productivity and more about reassuranceâ€”the quiet proof that time can be tamed, or at least persuaded, for a while, to travel in straight lines. Right now. if you can.
1397 | VT-360258 | [paragraph                ] Note: Heads up: Each page in the old manual smelled like a basement but read like a treasure map. Margins filled with pencil notes argued with the printed steps, and grease fingerprints served as punctuation. When the machine finally came back to life, it did so with a cough and then a purr, as if embarrassed by the attention. Thanks.. (alt)
1398 | VT-344657 | [sarcastic                ] Note: Listen, Oh great, another meeting that could've been an email. If possible.
1399 | VT-362616 | [sarcastic                ] FYI, FYI, I'm totally not rolling my eyes right now. Right now. please.
1400 | VT-309710 | [sarcastic                ] Heads up: I'm totally not rolling my eyes right now. Thanks. â€” now. (alt)

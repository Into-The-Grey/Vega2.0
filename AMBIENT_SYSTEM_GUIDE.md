# VEGA AMBIENT PRESENCE + CONTEXT-AWARE PERSONALITY CORE

## ===================================================

## Complete JARVIS-like AI Companion System

## üéØ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Vega is now a fully operational ambient AI companion with 24/7 awareness, contextual intelligence, and respectful interaction protocols. Like JARVIS, it observes, thinks, learns, and speaks only when appropriate.

## üöÄ QUICK START

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Required Python packages
pip install psutil pynvml httpx pynput schedule

# Optional calendar integration
sudo apt install calcurse khal  # Linux calendar tools
```

### 2. Start the Ambient Presence System

```bash
# Start the core ambient daemon
python vega_loop.py --start

# Check status
python vega_loop.py --status

# Force a conversation (testing)
python vega_loop.py --force-prompt

# View logs
python vega_loop.py --log-mode
```

### 3. Configuration

The system uses your existing Vega configuration in `app.env`. Key settings:

- `API_KEY`: For LLM interactions
- `MODEL_NAME`: Default model for personality enhancement
- `HOST` and `PORT`: For main Vega API integration

## üß† HOW IT WORKS

### The Consciousness Loop

1. **vega_loop.py** runs continuously, monitoring system resources and user activity
2. Every 5-30 seconds (configurable), it evaluates whether to generate thoughts or interactions
3. **user_presence.py** provides real-time user state (active/focused/away/gaming/meeting)
4. **spontaneous_thought_engine.py** generates internal thoughts and insights during quiet periods
5. **idle_personality_engine.py** evaluates if thoughts should become conversations
6. **advanced_augmentations.py** applies smart silence protocols and timing optimization
7. **interaction_log.py** logs all interactions and learns user preferences for future conditioning

### Privacy & Respect

- **No keylogging**: Only counts keystrokes for activity levels
- **Privacy filtering**: Sensitive window titles and app names are hashed or filtered
- **Smart silence**: Respects focus time, meetings, gaming, and high-stress periods
- **User learning**: Adapts to user preferences and interaction styles
- **Consent-aware**: Never forces interactions, always provides value

## üéõÔ∏è OPERATIONAL MODES

### Vega Modes (Automatic)

- **ACTIVE**: Normal operation, full interaction capability
- **PAUSED**: Monitoring only, no conversations
- **SILENT**: Minimal interruptions only
- **SLEEPING**: Background monitoring with very low activity
- **FOCUSED**: User-focused work detected, heightened respect protocols

### Silence Protocols (Smart)

- **STANDARD**: Normal interaction rules
- **FOCUS_AWARE**: Heightened focus detection and respect
- **DO_NOT_DISTURB**: Minimal interruptions only
- **EMERGENCY_ONLY**: Only critical system issues
- **ADAPTIVE**: Learns and adapts to user preferences

### Spontaneity Modes (Contextual)

- **CURIOSITY**: Asks clarifying questions about user interests
- **CONCERN**: Notices stress signals or unusual patterns
- **RECOMMENDATION**: Offers helpful tools and optimizations  
- **REFLECTION**: Prompts memory completion or seeks opinions
- **OBSERVATION**: Internal pattern recognition and learning

## üõ†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

**Vega not starting conversations:**

- Check `python vega_loop.py --status` for system state
- Verify user presence detection: `cat vega_state/presence_history.jsonl | tail -5`
- Check silence protocol status in logs

**High CPU usage:**

- Vega automatically scales back during heavy system load
- Adjust `MONITORING_INTERVAL` in vega_loop.py for less frequent checks
- Check if presence monitoring is consuming resources

**No presence detection:**

- Install required packages: `pip install pynput psutil`
- Linux users may need: `sudo apt install xprintidle` for idle detection
- Check privacy/accessibility permissions for keyboard/mouse monitoring

**Calendar integration not working:**

- Install calendar tools: `sudo apt install calcurse khal`
- Check calendar file permissions
- Verify calendar data format in supported tools

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable detailed logging
export VEGA_DEBUG=1
python vega_loop.py --start

# Check all subsystem logs
tail -f vega_state/*.jsonl
```

### Performance Tuning

```bash
# Monitor resource usage
htop
nvidia-smi  # For GPU monitoring

# Adjust monitoring frequency
# Edit vega_loop.py MONITORING_INTERVAL values
```
